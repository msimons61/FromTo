I want to add extra functionality and complexity to our project.

1. I want use SwiftData
2. I want use iCloud for:
   a) syncing data models and share with my other iOS devices
   b) using the Key-value storage to migrate data out off UserDefaults.

I've created a Cloudkit container with identifier "iCloud.com.ms61consultancy.FromTo"

I've already added the iCloud capability

- Key-value storage\
- Cloudkit

- Create a SwiftData model from the data in the Investment view.
- Add a date field.
- Refactor the Investment view to an InvestmentDetails view
- Create an InvestmentList view as its parent view
- Create an intermediary investment object or InvestmentDetails view parameters or prevent immediate update of the underlying data. The user must tap the Save button first.

Are my requirements clear.
